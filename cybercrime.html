<h1>Cyber Security</h1>

<h2>What does Cybersecurity do? </h2>

</strong>
</p>
<p>According to Western Governors University (W.G.U, n.d.) the main function of a qualified cybersecurity expert is to maintain and recognise business setup in element, by monitoring the network frequently, and assess risks that could possibly breach it, through continuous observation to improve enhancement of business network safety and to defend delicate data. A cybersecurity professional will take responsibility in,</p>
<ol>
<li>	Using password defence applications, anti-virus platforms and exposure control software.</li>
<li>	Reporting on current events within a network and its strong points.</li>
<li>	Identifying any weak points in the network, by continuously examining the network before any bad actors or outside threats that try to concede it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h2>
<p>There are several high-quality bits of technology that play an important role in cyber-crime prevention, they not only include physical technology but can also include software updates and policies that can be implemented to improve the privacy and protection of personal information and not impede on any governing laws within a particular country. Some of these technologies include Two-Factor Authentication, behaviour analytics, pin and/or password protection and blockchain cybersecurity (I.F.F, 2019).</p>
<h3>Two Factor Authentication (2FA):</h3>
<p>According to Golla et al (2021) two factor authentication roughly began in 2011 to increase account protection, submitted through big online facilities to add an extra layer of security to password-based validations. There are three types of 2FA,</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“One-Time Passwords”</strong> (OTP), usually sent through SMS, emails apps, or calls for the operator to enter in</li>
  <li><strong>“Tap to sign-in”</strong> (Push) a notice applied in an application that requires approval by the operator</li>
  <li><strong>Security keys</strong> that the operator must validate through submission</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of 2FA work to block phishing and certificate packing breaches, which takes advantage by misusing the user’s inclination to repeat passwords. It can be time consuming, repetitive and would require more effort to use these as the authentication processes are constantly changing. Even though this may be seen as an issue, most users still commonly recognise 2FA as a practical defence against hacking of their accounts (Golla, et al., 2021).</p>

<h3>Behaviour Analytics:</h3>
<p>Behaviour Analytics are used by many sellers to help assess the activities of consumers and other bodies, to uncover the possible cases normally displayed as activity, that is in breach of the normal outlines and conducts of consumers and organisations (I.F.F, 2019). Some instances of such behaviours include uncommon access to systems and data with-in the main network or mediators, and violations made by outside invaders avoiding cyber safety regulations.  Although it can be unpredictable to create a defence from past occurrences, due to invention of new offensive tactics and devices, the moment a team can create a new regulation and abolish the possibility of upcoming related offences in the time ahead, a direct hit of the same kind will have minimal differences to former attacks.</p>
<p>Ways to track common attacks can be done through the monitoring, analysis and response to any invading entities that are detected through continuous observation of structures, and any deviating or spiteful events on the network (Krasznay & Hámornik, 2018)</p>

<h2>What can be done now? </h2>
<p>Success can be reached today by forming a skill requirement in cyber security within a corporation, where very employee has their specified task to help undertake guidelines and procedures, which include,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing effective policies and methods for workers and companies</li>
  <li>Attempting to design a system that can identify fake emails</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity awareness education on policies and methods to all employees</li>
  <li>Maintaining up to date with latest versions of software on networks, devices, and software</li>
  <li>Creating a backup of data and information on a constant basis</li>
  <li>Caution of unexpected email links</li>
  <li>Avoid downloading from unverified sources (unknown sources)</li>
  <li>Keeping away from using public Wi-Fi connectivity</li>
  <li>Setting all social interaction profiles to private</li>
  <li>Activating privacy settings on social networks</li>
  <li>Monitoring of kid’s activities through parental controls, e.g., limiting access to what kids can view online</li>
  <li><strong>Reference:</strong> (Raj Singh Deora, 2021)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though these methods can help to improve cybersecurity the main concern surrounding it, is that as more devices connect, the harder it is to close the gap for security measures. In saying this, risk management has been around for years prior to computers but has recently been enforced in information technology by many organisations around the world, to try and close the gap (Kosub, 2015). Reasons for this is that as technology advances so does cybercrime, which in turn requires more cybersecurity efforts in establishing effective protection.</p>

<h2>What is likely to be able to be done soon? (Say in the next 3 years) </h2>

<p>Cybersecurity will likely comprise of multiple correcting combinations of fields including, computer science, mathematics, economics, law, psychology, and engineering. In the upcoming years it will not only involve devices connecting through networks, but it will also combine how humans interact and how they are influenced using technological devices, while keeping up with the gap between growing technologies and the skills required to protect users (Dawson J, 2018).</p>

<h2>What technological or other developments make this possible? </h2>
<p>Gaurav (2021) mentions the advancement in AI security and how it has been adopted by many business front-runners, by implementing AI algorithms that detect, protect, and respond against new threats. While cyber-attacks and connecting devices are trending at an exponential rate in society, using AI and ML can help level the playing field with cybercriminals, automatic threat discovery, and react more successfully than predictable software enhancing and physical techniques. Two ways to even the gap between cybercrime and security are,</p>

<h3>Detecting New Threats</h3>

<p>Using AI to detect cyber risks and malicious activities, by implementing sophisticated algorithms to train the AI to identify malware, run pattern recognition, and detect tiny conduct of malware or ransomware.</p>

<h3>Breach Risk Prediction</h3>

<p>Applying different points of contact to various networks, means the AI can regulate the IT skill register that involves a precise and detailed documentation of devices, operators, and functions. AI systems can forecast how and where the network or infrastructure maybe be conceded, to strategically assign properties in parts that contain the most exposure to cyber threats.</p>

<p>As humans are unable to balance security to an original close, AI implements the necessary requirement for examination and risk recognition, used by cybersecurity professionals to lower the chance of a violation risk and make improvements toward a secure position in the cyber world.</p>

<h2> What is the potential impact of this development?</h2>

<p>Cyber threats today is “almost exclusively used to describe information security matters” (Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21). Cyber threats can cause major issues. From having your personal accounts stolen and used  against your will, if your electronic device was not hacked that does not mean the corporation that you are signed up to won’t be hacked. “Cyber threats are a big deal. Cyber attacks can cause blackouts, failure of military equipment, and breaches in national security secrets”(Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21).  The overall development of cybercrime is very worrisome, knowing that you should not connect to any internet device that is not your own is not something that everyone abides by. In fact a lot of young people are interested in learning how to hack, and this is what peaks there interest in I.T. The UK government have developed a game worth $20 million dollars to help encourage young people to learn cyber security so they can bridge the gap between white hat and black hat hackers. ( Davey Winder, 3.9.19)</p>


<h2>What is likely to change? </h2> <p>
	Cyber threats never stay the same, they are always evolving into something bigger and more potent. There are even some security threats right now that do not carry a detectable digital signature ( Hugh Taylor, 16.7.21). The best practice for defending against a cyber security threat is as simple as patching systems. A company will issue updates to their systems due to the fact they have found an exploit and need to fix it. Educating people on why it is important to do these updates is also an excellent step in helping reduce the number of personal hacks that can occur.
</p>
<h2>Which people will be most affected and how? </h2><p>

	47 percent of Americans experienced financial identity theft in 2020. These losses amounted to $712.4 Billion dollars in 2020 (Insurance Information Institute). Statistics referred to by the Insurance Information Institute state that “The highest percentage of consumers who were victimized in 2020 were between 35 and 44 years of age and accounted for 30 percent of all identity theft victims”. That is roughly 213 billion dollars for that age category. That age bracket is definitely not what we were expecting as a large component of identity theft victims. The implications of this age bracket is only going to get worse as they get older due to the more potent hacks that people are coming up with today. “One cyber security company estimates that global cybercrime cost will grow by 15% per over the next five years, reaching US$10.5 Trillion annually by 2025, which is up from US$3T in 2015 ( Australian Institute of Criminology, 07/21)”. That is a staggering amount of money.</p>
<h2>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h2> <p>
	This will definitely create jobs. In Australia alone we offer courses under FREE-TAFE which is a tafe that is paid for by the government for you and you do not need to pay them back. One of these that is heavily pushed is Cyber Security. “Few industries are growing as fast as the cyber security industry”(ECU, 02.03.21). If anything cyber security will force people to innovate and create to stop people from stealing personal information.
</p>

<h2>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h2>

	<p>Cyber Crime already affects me. I currently have a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> on the way which will help act as two factor authentication for my personal devices. It will have NFC functionality and USB connectivity. The reason I have chosen to get one of these is because when I was much younger, I fell victim to cyber crime. This was only in a game, so it did not affect me at all, however it did cause me to always have a code generating authentication key from then forward. In my daily life it will be annoying at times to have such a functionality, however it is short term pain to adjust to using more than just a password to keep files and personal data safe.</p>


<h2>What will be different for you?  </h2><p>

Overall cyber crime changes how I view everything and anything I do online. I will always be more vigilant in what I put online. I already do not like the use of social media, nor do I like the apps they put out to send messages to friends, family and acquaintances. </p>
<h2>How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h2><p>
	Cyber crime has already affected friends and family members. Instructing them to contact people via an encrypted messaging service such as <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, they find it a nuisance and simply do not want to go to the effort. Or they believe we are being “silly”. Cyber crime is a serious thing, especially in today’s technological age. People will only take you seriously once it has happened to them and they have a mistake to learn from. </p>
